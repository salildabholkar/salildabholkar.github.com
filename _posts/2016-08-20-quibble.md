{{ BASE_PATH }}

Quibble is a marks entering software which automates the process of Internal Assessment Tests mapping with course outcome mapping and various marks calculations.
It makes use of a database to store all details required, allowing the user to pickup their work from where they left-off. It does various sanity checks and validations to avoid potential mistakes. The software automatically generates attainment for each Course outcome dependent on given criteria.

## Need
+ Currently, teachers have to create excel sheets manually to map the Course Outcomes (CO) with each question.
+ This includes adding formulae for and color coding the attainment of each student manually.
+ This is a very tedious task which can take several hours.
+ Marks of students also need to be entered out-of-order according to the CO order instead of the usual question order adding to the frustrations.

## Technologies used
+ [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/){:target="_blank"}
+ [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io){:target="_blank"}
+ [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/){:target="_blank"}
+ Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Minimum Requirements
+ **Processor:** 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor
+ **OS:** Windows 7 or above
+ **RAM:** 1GB or above
+ **Space:** 160MB free
+ Internet Connection

## Workflow
The workflow of the entire system is as illustrated below:

## Implementation Details
+ In order to use the application teachers will have to register with their official SFIT email ID (@sfitengg.org). The registration details will be stored in the [firebase auth database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/){:target="_blank"}.
+ These registration details will be their login credentials whenever they have to use the software.
+ After login, teachers will enter the details like class, year, etc. for which they want to enter the marks and/or mapping.
+ There will be a lookup in the database to see if the student list of that class for that year already exists else teachers will have to upload the excel sheet consisting of student name, PID no and roll no.
+ After details, teachers will enter CO of each question unless already entered.
+ The CO mapping is stored in the [Firebase Realtime database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/){:target="_blank"}.
+ Teachers will then start entering marks of each student. If the teachers already have entered marks in an excel file (for previous years), the marks can be entered directly by uploading the excel file.
+ They can also resume the marks entering as the data will be stored in the realtime database.
+ A tick will appear next to the names of students whose marks have been entered.
+ After entering marks of all the required students, teacher can generate the CO mapping table with all marks and attainments automatically generated.
+ The PDF of this table can be saved automatically to the desktop.

## Key features

### Web based

### login

### Read student list from excel

### Read previous marks from excel

### Automatic computations and color Coding

### All data in database

## Future work
+ As material design is used to create the application, the same framework can be used to create an android app for better productivity and mobility.
+ As all the data is stored in the database, data analytics and visualization can also be performed. *(Already started in some capacity)*
