My name is Salil. 
I currently work as a Web Application Developer at Media.net, 
a global leader in contextual advertising.

I love to blog about my exploits in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
The code for most of them is available on my github repo.

My primary area of interest lies in the intersection of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
